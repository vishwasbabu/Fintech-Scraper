## Usage

1. Run the scraper to download investor materials:

```bash
python3 scraper.py
```

This creates a `scraped_data/` directory with one subfolder per company. Run the script periodically (e.g. using cron) or invoke `schedule_daily()` to keep the data up to date.

2. Start the web UI:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/` in a browser to browse available companies and their files. Market data for public tickers is fetched from Yahoo Finance.

Note: the `push_to_chatgpt` function in `scraper.py` is a placeholder for pushing downloaded files to a custom ChatGPT instance.

## Troubleshooting

If you receive HTTP 403 errors when running the scraper, some sites may block requests without a browser-like user agent. The tool includes a default `User-Agent` header, but you can edit `USER_AGENT` in `scraper.py` if downloads continue to fail.

If some investor pages load content dynamically and the initial request times out, the scraper can optionally fall back to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). Install it with:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

Playwright is only used when standard requests fail, so it is safe to run the scraper without it if you don't need this feature.
